# 2018.01 Android Widget Development

## 2018.01.29

I installed Android Studio per the instructions on the website. I'm
pretty familiar with IntelliJ, so not bothering documenting all that.

My initial project idea is to learn about widgets and the system APIs
for creating a widget for dealing with alarms and timers. We'll see
how possible/practical this is.

I decided to use the latest API, 27, for Android 8.1 since I'm
interested in learning the newest recommendations and don't need my
personal apps running on other devices.

I also decided to use Kotlin since I've played with it before as a
Java alternative and like its reduced verbosity.

40 minutes of downloading and configuring (mostly downloading) got me
this starting point repo: https://github.com/philipwilcox/ClockManager

Note that I created this as an empty activity, not knowing anything
about them to guide my starting point otherwise.

Trying to run it out of the box gives me a dialog showing that I
already have a "Nexus 5X API 27 x86" virtual device, which seems fine
for now. I'll connect my phone later.
* It blows up with "Missing initial data partition file" wtf...
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47895124/emulator-emulator-error-missing-initial-data-partition-file well that's stupid, but yeah, running a second time fixed that, but it's actually failing on trying to load openGL drivers!
* Setting it to software graphics driver fixes that, seems there's an old bug that I need to work around for getting hardware graphics working later with Intel drivers... https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=213192

I'll pick up there later, bleh.
