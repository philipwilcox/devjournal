# 2017.12 Node/Vue.js

## 2017.12.25

With the basic env set up, time to get some Vue sample code actually running.

First step: set up a vue project.
* I installed `npx` globally with `npm install -g npx` -- this is a utility for running binaries from a local non-global dependency install.
* I think can install `vue-cli` as a local dev dependency, `npm install vue-cli --save-dev` instead of needing it globally.
* `npm vue init webpack vuetest` works, then, to scaffold the project.
* **At this point I had to overwrite the package json stuff I'd done before, as this basically superseded (but initially in a subdirectory) the npm setup I did yesterday. This required some git reshuffling too.**

I considered taking a detour into TypeScript here, but decided not to, as that would just be piling more stuff onto the learning curve. We can come back to that later. _Or, possibly more interesting, once I have a real app, consider porting to Elm or such instead._

Looking at https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/vue-js-2-quickstart-tutorial-2017-246195cfbdd2 in addition to main vue guide (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Getting-Started).

Some project basics:
* `src/main.js` is main Vue entry point
* Since I installed vue-router, the component loaded inside the App top-level one is dynamic based on my route definition. **Learn more about this later.**
* Note for future from some other docs I was reading: Vue makes a clear separation between _directives_ (DOM manipulations only) and _components_ (include state, biz logic).

I was able to tweak the default HelloWorld.vue single-page component, and then fork it and replace it with a HelloPhil version. I also played with converting stome static HTML to data-driven loop-rendered list of links.

I'm working today in my `vuetest` repository, and once familiar with the basics will move on to a "real" app prototype.

`npm init` sets up a new node project in a directory.
`npm install vue` installs the stable version.
I added both package.json and package-lock.json to version control.

Next: do an initial push of this to github.
* https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/ 
* `git remote add origin git@github.com:philipwilcox/vuetest.git`
* `git push -u origin master`

While doing this, I also installed visual studio code, and got the directory imported in both Code and IntelliJ 2016.

First step: how do I manage NPM versions and get my node dependencies installed?
Today's environment: Linux Arch

* https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node points, for Linux, at install script https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installation of "nvm" node version manager 
* After installing nvm (note: it's a bash function, not a binary, so 'which' won't work), install the desired npm version with `nvm install node` for latest version or `nvm install â€“lts`  http://nodesource.com/blog/installing-node-js-tutorial-using-nvm-on-mac-os-x-and-ubuntu/  
* Then use the latest version with `nvm use node` or with `nvm use --lts` for lts 

Second step, for next time: how to get Vue itself set up. To mimic what I'd do at work, I'm going to go straight ahead to managing with npm, not just dropping in the source file.
